### om7-beta : Visual Programming | Computer-Aided Music Compositon

OpenMusic (OM) is a visual programming language based on Common Lisp. Visual programs are created by assembling and connecting icons representing Lisp functions and data structures, built-in control structures (e.g. loops), and other program constructs. OM may be used as a general purpose visual programming language, and reuse any existing Common Lisp code. At a more specialized level, a set of in-built tools and external libraries make it a powerful environment for music composition. Various classes implementing musical structures are provided, associated with graphical editors including common music notation, MIDI, OSC, 2D/3D curves, and audio buffers.
